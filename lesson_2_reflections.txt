What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You create the directory that will record the meta data for future commits.
Without it one would just be saving failes, and not recording the commits.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
It allows one to double check to make sure the files one is wanting to commit are included in the current commit.
